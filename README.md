# Lessons\_Calc

## About the Project

`Lessons_Calc` is a simple C# learning project containing console/Windows (depending on the structure) examples of a calculator and practical exercises. The repository collects lessons and small programs for practicing C# syntax and fundamental programming techniques.

> If your project differs from this description (for example, it is a GUI app or a set of exercises on "switch"), let me know so I can adjust the README accordingly.

## Features (Example)

* Basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
* Examples of using the `switch` statement (e.g., `Lessons_Switch`)
* Demonstrations of methods, conditions, and loops

## Requirements

* .NET SDK (latest stable version recommended — .NET 6/7/8)
* Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code or any other C# editor

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MykytaOleksandrovychVakarenko/Lessons_Calc.git
cd Lessons_Calc
```

2. Open `Lessons_Calc.sln` in Visual Studio or run from the terminal:

```bash
# If you are in the solution folder
dotnet build
dotnet run --project ./<project_path>
```

Replace `<project_path>` with the specific project folder (e.g., `Lessons_Switch`) if the repository contains multiple projects.

## Repository Structure (Example)

```
Lessons_Calc/
├─ Lessons_Switch/        # Project with switch statement examples
├─ Lessons_Calc.sln       # Visual Studio solution
├─ .gitignore
├─ README.md
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Commit your changes and push: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
4. Open a Pull Request.

Commit message tip: keep them short and descriptive, e.g., `Add: switch examples for lesson 3`.

## Possible Improvements

* Add detailed run instructions for each project in the solution.
* Write unit tests (xUnit / NUnit) for core methods.
* Add CI (GitHub Actions) for automatic builds and tests.

## License

Add a `LICENSE` file (MIT is a good choice for learning projects).
